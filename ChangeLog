Version 1.0.5 (July 6, 2003):
- Corrected a bug related to the computation of the incidence structure.

Version 1.0.4 (February 9, 2001):
- The format of the incidence file changed from time to time in the past.
  To become independent of these changes, the incidence structure is now
  derived from the vertex and the facette information. Thus, the incidence
  file becomes obsolete. A further advantage of this change is that the
  incidence file necessarily depends on the order of the entries in the
  facette and the vertex file. With the new implementation, rows may be
  interchanged freely in these two files.

Version 1.0.3 (February 4, 2001):
- changed the implementation of the incidence structure. Instead of the
  normal set implementation (ordered lists of vertices) to represent a facet,
  a boolean array indexed by the vertices is used. Since in our case
  intersections of sets are in fact only intersections of a set with a facet,
  these are implemented faster now by looking up all the elements of the set
  in the boolean array of the facet. Precomputations of hyperplane
  intersections are useless now, so that the '-p'-options are dropped.
  Overall, 'rch' and 'hot' become noticeably faster on near-simple input.
- removed the concept of memory reserve, which was not very useful in
  practice (for instance, because of virtual memory)

Version 1.0.2 (January 7, 2001):
- removed the volume computation methods 'cdd+', 'cdd-' and 'qhull',
  which were not very efficient on our examples and furthermore depended
  on external programmes so that maintaining them would have needed 
  continual work
- removed the volume computation methods 'gs' and 'gsh' because Gram-
  Schmidt orthonormalisation was numerically unstable
- removed the volume computation method 'hoth' because storing intermediate
  volumes of faces with the incident hyperplanes as key is not efficient;
  it requires more memory and in degenerate polytopes does not allow to
  recognise all faces when they appear again
- removed all reminiscents of code for centre of gravity computation; this   
  is more easily reprogrammed from scratch

Version 1.0.1 (January 5, 2001):
- incorporated the modifications made in Zurich; mainly changed the time
  measurement
